1. To allow github-pages rendering, make a subtree for the web folder under gh-pages branch
    - `git subtree push --prefix web origin gh-pages`
    - This needs to be called every time there's changes on master.
2. Then from `Settings` > `Pages`, select the `gh-pages` branch and the `/ (root)` folder. Then click save.
