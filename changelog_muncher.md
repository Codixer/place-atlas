# list of changes

- changed the descriptions of The Knight, Ranni the Witch, and the Bench project to be more descriptive
- changed “Schr[\u code for ö]dinger” to “Schrödinger”, “Thomas\u2019…” to "Thomas’", “Ata\u00fcrk's” to “Atatürk’s” and “Atat\u00fcrk” to “Atatürk” (there could be an entire PR for fixing all of the \u inserts, there are *way too many* and I’m stopping myself before I waste my entire school day on this)
- fixed the \n woes in the Meteor description and made it easier to read
- fixed the spelling of “Soul’s” to “Souls’” in the Bench description (Idk how I made that error)
- Redrew the outlines of The Knight and the Hat Kid hat
